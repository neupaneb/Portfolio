          <h3>Soccer Stats - Soccer League Team Statistics Tracker</h3>
          <p>Description of my project:</p>
          <p>
            The Soccer Statistics Tracker is a Java program designed to keep
            track of team statistics for a soccer league. It serves as a
            comprehensive tool for monitoring and analyzing the performance of
            soccer teams based on game scores reported throughout the season.
            The program reads data from a CSV file containing match details,
            such as team names and goals scored, and calculates various
            statistics, including wins, draws, losses, goals scored, goals
            conceded, and points earned. Additionally, it provides functionality
            to identify the best-performing team based on points earned and goal
            differentials, as well as high-scoring teams in the league.

            Research on the topic of “Are Online Classes Better Way to Learn New
            Languages than Physical Classes.”
          </h3>
          <p>Description of my research paper:</p>
          <p>
            In collaboration with Dr. Ruth E. Smith, Director of the School of
            Humanities, I conducted research into the effectiveness of language
            learning methods. Our study unveiled compelling insights,
            demonstrating the superiority of traditional physical classes over
            online platforms in fostering language acquisition. Through
            meticulous analysis and comparison, we elucidated the nuanced
            dynamics at play, showcasing the distinct advantages offered by
            in-person instruction in facilitating comprehensive language
            learning experiences. This research not only underscores the
            enduring value of traditional pedagogical approaches but also
            provides valuable guidance for educators and institutions seeking to
            optimize language learning outcomes in an increasingly digital
            landscape.
